\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem-3.3.5}
	Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a non-empty set, let $c \in A$, let $f, g : A \to \mathbb{R}$ be functions and let $k \in \mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $c$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $f + g$ is continuous at $c$.
		\item $f - g$ is continuous at $c$.
		\item $kf$ is continuous at $c$.
		\item $fg$ is continuous at $c$.
		\item If $g\left(c\right) \neq 0$, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is continuous at $c$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
