\section{Two Important Theorems}
\begin{theorem}[Extreme Value Theorem]
	\label{theorem-3.5.1}
	\index{Extreme Value Theorem}
	Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a closed bounded interval, and let $f:C\to\mathbb{R}$ be a function. Suppose that $f$ is continuous. Then there are $x_{\text{min}},x_{\text{max}}\in C$ such that
	\begin{equation*}
	f\left(x_{\text{min}}\right) \leq f\left(x\right)\leq f\left(x_{\text{max}}\right)
	\end{equation*}
	for all $x \in C$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Intermediate Value Theorem]
	\label{theorem-3.5.2}
	\index{Intermediate Value Theorem}
	Let $\left[ a, b \right] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a closed bounded interval, and let $f:\left[ a, b \right]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a function. Suppose that $f$ is continuous. Let $r \in \mathbb{R}$. If $r$ is strictly between $f\left(a\right)$ and $f\left(b\right)$, then there is some $c \in \left( a, b \right)$ such that $f\left(c\right) = r$.
\end{theorem}
