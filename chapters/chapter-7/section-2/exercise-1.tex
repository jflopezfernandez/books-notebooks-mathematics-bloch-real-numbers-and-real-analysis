\begin{exercise}
	Prove that $\ln 2 > 0$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
	By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the derivative of $\ln x$ is $\frac{1}{x}$, which is positive for all values in the interval $\left( 0, \infty \right)$. Since its first derivative is positive for all values in $\left( 0, \infty \right)$, the function $\ln x$ is strictly increasing. By the Archimedean property of the real numbers, there exists at least one real number $c$ such that $1 < c < 2$, and we can therefore conclude that $\ln 1 < \ln c < \ln 2$. Since $0 = \ln 1$, we have that $0 < \ln 2$, as required.
\end{proof}
